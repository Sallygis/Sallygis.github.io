		<p>Hi, I'm Salema Giscombe. This is my personal website.</p><hr>

			<!-- Question 3 a. -->
			<h2> <u>Personality</u> </h2>
			<h3>My Strongest Trait and Its Impact on my Academic Life</h3>
				<p>What would i consider my traits and hobbies?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Introversion</li>
						<li>Adaptability</li>
						<li>Perfectionist</li>
						<li>Procrastinator</li>
						<li>Swimming</li>
						<li>Crochet</li>
						<li>Listening to music</li>
						<li>Reading romance novels or light novels</li>
					</ul><br>
				<p>My strongest trait is that I'm a perfectionist and my worst trait being I'm a procrastinator.
				Being a perfectionist and a procrastinator can have both positive and negative impacts on my 
				school or academic life. Let's explore how these traits can affect academic performance:
					<ul>
						<li>Positive Impacts</li>
							<ul>
								<li>High Standards</li>
								<li>Attention to Detail</li>
								<li>Thoroughness</li>
								<li>Pressure Performance</li>
								<li>Creativity</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Negative Impacts</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Time-Consuming</li>
								<li>Stress and Anxiety</li>
								<li>Procrastination</li>
								<li>Missed Deadlines</li>
								<li>Quality Compromised</li>
								<li>Stress and Anxiety</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				</p><br>
				<p>How does it affect my academic life? </p>
					<p style="padding-left:20px">
					I may delay starting tasks because I fear not meeting my own high standards. 
					This can lead to procrastination, creating a cycle of stress and missed deadlines. 
					Managing time effectively is crucial for students. I sometimes struggle to allocate time efficiently 
					due to being focused on perfection, while also struggling to manage time wisely, leading to last-minute rushes. 
					To thrive academically, it's essential to find a balance. This might involve setting realistic goals, breaking 
					tasks into smaller, manageable steps, and seeking support when necessary. Developing time management skills and 
					practicing self-compassion can also help mitigate the negative impacts of perfectionism and procrastination on academic life.

			<!-- Question 3 b -->
			<h3>Personal Quote</h3>
				<p>One of my favorite quotes "You've gotta crave it and chase it..."
				conveys a powerful message about determination, ambition, and the pursuit of one's goals and dreams.</p>
					<blockquote>
						You've gotta crave it and chase it until you're close enough to taste it.
					</blockquote><br>
				<ul>What it means:
					<li>To Crave it
						<ul>
							<li>To "crave" something means to have a strong and intense desire for it.</li>
							<li>"it" refers to a specific goal or aspiration that you deeply desire to achieve.</li>
							<li>This part of the quote emphasizes the importance of having a burning passion or longing for your goal.</li>
							<li>It's not enough to casually want something; you must have an insatiable hunger for it.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>To Chase It
						<ul>
							<li>"Chasing" in this context signifies taking active and relentless steps toward your goal.</li>
							<li>It implies that you should be proactive and determined in your pursuit, not passive or complacent.</li>
							<li>Chasing your goal involves hard work, dedication, and perseverance.</li>
							<li>It's about actively seeking opportunities, making sacrifices, and overcoming obstacles to move 
							closer to your objective.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Taste it
						<ul>
							<li>This part of the quote emphasizes the idea that you should keep pushing yourself 
							until you are on the verge of achieving your goal.</li>
							<li>It suggests that you should continue your efforts until you can almost "taste" the 
							success or fulfillment that comes with accomplishing what you set out to do.</li>
							<li> It's about not giving up when you're close to the finish line.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Personality Assessment</h3>
				<!-- The external link is here -->
				<p>I took the <a href="http://similarminds.com/" target="_blank">Keirsey Temperament Sorter personality test</a> 
				to assess my personality.</p>
    
				<!-- Embed the screenshot image here -->
				<img src="..\Assets\Screenshot.png" alt="Personality Test Results">
    
				<p>
					Personality tests like the one categorizing individuals as "Guardians" often have a degree of validity in general.
					They are based on established psychological theories and research, and they can provide insights into broad 
					personality traits and tendencies. However, it's crucial to understand that personality is complex, and no single 
					test can fully capture its nuances. Moreover, different tests may yield slightly different results. I believe 3/4 of
					the information is correct. The first 3 conjectures appears to be in line with my personality, however I dont participate
					in societal actions, injustice, etc.
